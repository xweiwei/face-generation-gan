# Generating faces with GANs

This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on celebrity faces to generate new faces that don't appear in the training set. This method for generating faces is really cool and can actually reach equilibrium fairly quickly when compared to training other types of neural networks, such as LSTM cells. 

GANs are made up of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, and use a set of real images to train (faces of celebrities in this case). The discriminator's job is to look at images and determine if they are real or fake. The generator's job is to transform noise vectors into images that trick the discriminator into classifying them as real. By putting the two networks in competition with each other, we force both networks to become very good at their job. Below is an example of some faces my GAN was able to generate.

I think the results you can get with GANs when doing image generation are pretty amazing and a huge leap forward in machines being able to think, rather than learn how to mimic doing a task through human-curated data. This last summer (2017), researchers at Rutgers had another breakthrough making machines be able to think creatively. I wrote a short explaination on the Creative Adversarial Networks they introduced the world to in their paper.
